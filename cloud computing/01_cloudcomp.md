# CLOUD COMPUTING

Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. 

You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
## Top benefits of cloud computing

1. Cost Effecient
2. Speed
3. Scaleability
4. Productivity
5. Reliability
6. Performance
7. Security

## Cloud computing is broken down into three broad catagories;

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):

IaaS is a form of Utility Computing it allows businesses to purchase infrastructure from providers as virtual resources on an ‘as needed’ basis. This virtual hardware includes computers, raw processors, storage software platforms and so on. Instead of being physically based in an office, the hardware is located in the ‘cloud’ and data is accessed via the internet. Their big providers are Amazon, Sun, IBM, Rackspace and Google.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS):

PaaS provides a platform on which you can create and deploy custom apps, databases and line-of-business services integrated into one platform. You build your own applications that run on the provider's infrastructure and are delivered to your users via the Internet from the provider's servers. Usually this will include an operating system, programming environment, database and web server.

Examples of PaaS include Windows Azure, Google App Engine, Salesforce.com's Force.com and Coghead. For extremely lightweight development, cloud-based mashup platforms abound, such as Yahoo Pipes or Dapper.net.

### Software as a Service (SaaS):

With SaaS a single application is delivered through the browser to thousands of customers on a subscription basis using a multitenant architecture – in other words, you run the software remotely through a browser, without having to go through a lengthy installation processes or worrying about how your hardware will cope with the application. On the customer side, it means no upfront investment in servers or software licensing; on the provider side, with just one app to maintain, costs are low compared to conventional hosting.
